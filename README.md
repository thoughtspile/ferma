# Le form

I want to love native HTML forms. I really do. But 

1. Custom client-side validation
2. Easy integration with server-side validation
3. Stylable error messages
4. JS action on successful submit

Design constraints:

1. Works with vanilla JS
2. As small as possible
3. No components or CSS â€” bring your own

MVP non-goals:

1. No integration with component libraries
2. No server-side part

## Install

```sh
npm install --save leform
```
